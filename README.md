# ENGR_Final

What does it do?
Running this code will create a game similar to 'Simon Says.
A noise followed by a sequence of lights appears and you must do the correct action that matches with the color of the light appearing. Depending on what colors the lights are and the order that they go off in, a player will press different buttons or make a noise in the same sequence as the lights. The lights will slowly loop around until the end for your given time. You first choose the difficulty of the game (easy or hard) by choosing to move the switch or leave it. After this, you are given a practice round that will run through each light color to allow you to learn how to play. Once this is done. The game will randomly choose a light for you to match. As you get the colors right you will have less time between the intializing beep and the end of the color. Depending on the mode, you may reach the end of the levels or the time constraint chosen in easy or hard mode to win.

KEY:
Move switch = Hard mode
Green light = Left button
Blue light = Right button
Orange light = Make a loud noise

Levels?
There are 10 levels. Each level will add another color to the pattern. After the PRACTICE round you will begin with a pattern involving three lights. If correctly completed, you are then given a pattern involving four lights. Then you receive five lights, six lights, and so on until level 10 is completed.
Each Level will give 500 milliseconds less time before you must respond to the lights.

Rules?
1. Do the corresponding action after the initializing beep and before the lights reach the end of the board/until your time runs out.
2. If you do not do the action before the time runs out, you lose.
