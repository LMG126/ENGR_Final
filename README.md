# ENGR_Final

What does it do?
Running this code will create a game similar to 'Simon Says.'
A sequence of lights appears and you must do the correct action that matches with the color of the light appearing. 

Green light = left button
Blue light = right button
Orange light = make a loud noise

Levels?
There are 10 levels. Each level will add another color to the pattern. After the PRACTICE round you will begin with a pattern involving three lights. If correctly completed, you are then given a pattern involving four lights. Then you receive five lights, six lights, and so on until level 10 is completed.
Each Level will give 50 milliseconds less time before you must respond to the lights.

Rules?
